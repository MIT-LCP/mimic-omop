Mapping Table (collectively, the "Licensed Materials") for any commercial or
non-commercial purpose, subject to the following terms and conditions:

1. To prevent the dilution of the purpose of the LOINC codes and LOINC Table of
providing a definitive standard for identifying clinical information in
electronic reports, users shall not use any of the Licensed Materials for the
purpose of developing or promulgating a different standard for identifying
patient observations, such as laboratory test results; other diagnostic service
test results; clinical observations and measurements; reports produced by
clinicians and diagnostic services about patients; panels, forms, and
collections that define aggregations of these observations; and orders for these
entities in electronic reports and messages.

2. If the user elects to use the RELMA program, users receive the full RELMA
database and associated search index files with the RELMA program, including the
LOINC Table and other database tables comprising the RELMA database. In addition
to its use with the RELMA program, users may use the LOINC Table by itself and
may modify the LOINC Table as permitted herein. Users may not use or modify the
other database tables from the RELMA database or the associated search index
files except in conjunction with their authorized use of the RELMA program,
unless prior written permission is granted by the Regenstrief Institute, Inc. To
request written permission, please contact loinc@loinc.org. The RELMA program
also provides access to certain internet-based content copyrighted by
Regenstrief Institute, Inc. No additional permission to modify or distribute
this internet-based content is granted through the user's use of the RELMA
program.

3. The RELMA program also includes the RELMA Community Mappings feature and
access to the RELMA Community Mappings feature database. The accuracy and
completeness of the information in the RELMA Community Mappings feature is not
verified by Regenstrief Institute, Inc. or the LOINC Committee. Access to the
RELMA Community Mappings feature is enabled by a user authentication from the
RELMA login screen. If a user wishes to opt out of the RELMA Community Mappings
feature, they can simply use RELMA without logging in.
	a. By using the RELMA Community Mappings feature, users agree as follows:
		i. Users may not copy, distribute, or share access to the information
		provided by the RELMA Community Mappings feature.
		ii. Users accept the risk of using the information provided by the RELMA
		Community Mappings feature, recognize that such information is submitted
		by other users, and understand that neither Regenstrief Institute, Inc.
		nor the LOINC Committee are liable for the information provided by the
		RELMA Community Mappings feature.
		iii. Regenstrief Institute, Inc. may contact users regarding:
			1. Use of the RELMA Community Mappings feature;
			2. Submission requests for additional information; and
			3. Any mapping submissions that the user makes to the RELMA
			Community Mappings feature database;
		iv. Others may contact user about submissions made to the RELMA
		Community Mappings feature database;
		v. User will make reasonable efforts to submit user's mappings back to
		the RELMA Community Mappings feature database, which may contain the
		following information (as applicable):
			1. Local battery/panel/test code
			2. Local battery/panel/test name/description
			3. Units of Measure
			4. LOINC code to which it is mapped
			5. Date of mapping
			6. Language of test names
			7. Version of LOINC used to do the mapping
			8. Contact information;
		vi. If a user submits mappings on behalf of an organization, the user
		represents that the user has the authority to submit the mappings and to
		agree to these terms on behalf of the user's organization.
		vii. If a user submits mappings back to the RELMA Community Mappings
		feature database, then the user hereby grants, on behalf of themselves
		and the user's organization, Regenstrief Institute, Inc. a non-exclusive
		license without payment or fees to submitted mappings in perpetuity for
		purposes related to LOINC, RELMA, and Regenstrief Institute Inc.'s
		mission, including, but not limited to:
			1. Modifying the information;
			2. Making information publicly available;
			3. Performing aggregate analysis;
			4. Conducting and publishing research that does not identify user or
			user's organization by name;
			5. Developing and enhancing LOINC and associated software tools.

4. Users shall not change the meaning of any of the LOINC codes. Users shall not
change the name of, or any contents of, any fields in the LOINC Table or the
LOINC Table Core File. Users may add new fields to the LOINC Table and LOINC
Table Core File to attach additional information to existing LOINC records.
Users shall not change the content or structure of the LOINC Document Ontology
File, LOINC Answer File, LOINC Group File, LOINC Part File, or the LOINC Panels
and Forms File, but may notify the Regenstrief Institute, Inc. of any potential
inconsistencies or corrections needed by contacting loinc@loinc.org.

5. Users shall not use the LOINC parts or LOINC part hierarchies in any manner
except as they are presented in the Licensed Materials (and/or in other formats
of distribution approved by Regenstrief Institute, Inc.) to organize or be
constituents of LOINC terms. LOINC parts and LOINC part hierarchies shall
neither be used as a "standalone" terminology nor apart from LOINC terms. User
understands that LOINC parts and LOINC part hierarchies are subject to change,
addition, modification, or deletion, and are not strictly managed under the same
policies as LOINC terms.

6. A user may delete records from the LOINC Table or LOINC Table Core to deal
with the user's local requirements. A user also may add new records to the LOINC
Table and LOINC Table Core to deal with the users' local requirements, provided
that if new records are added, any new entry in the LOINC_NUM field of such new
records must contain a leading alphabetic "X" so that the new codes and records
cannot be confused with existing LOINC codes or new LOINC codes as they are
defined in later releases. Records deleted or added by users to deal with local
requirements are not reflected in the official LOINC Table and LOINC Table Core
maintained by the Regenstrief Institute, Inc. Users must also make reasonable
efforts to submit requests to LOINC for new records to cover observations that
are not found in the LOINC Table (and LOINC Table Core) in order to minimize the
need for X-codes.

7. LOINC codes and other information from the LOINC Table (and LOINC Table Core)
may be used in electronic messages for laboratory test results and clinical
observations such as HL7 ORU messages, without the need to include this
Copyright Notice and License or a reference thereto in the message (and without
the need to include all fields required by Section 9 hereof). When the LOINC
code (from the LOINC_NUM field) is included in the message, users are
encouraged, but not required, to include the corresponding LOINC short name
(from the SHORTNAME field) or the LOINC long common name (from the
LONG_COMMON_NAME field) in the message if the message provides a place for a
text name representation of the code.

8. Users may make and distribute an unlimited number of copies of the Licensed
Materials. Each copy thereof must include this Copyright Notice and License, and
must include the appropriate version number of the Licensed Materials if the
Licensed Materials have a version number, or the release date if the Licensed
Materials do not have a version number. This Copyright Notice and License must
appear on every printed copy of the LOINC Table (and LOINC Table Core). Where
the Licensed Materials are distributed on a fixed storage medium (such as
CD-ROM), a printed copy of this Copyright Notice and License must be included on
or with the storage medium, and a text file containing this information also
must be stored on the storage medium in a file called "license.txt". Where the
Licensed Materials are distributed via the Internet, this Copyright Notice and
License must be accessible on the same Internet page from which the Licensed
Materials are available for download. This Copyright Notice and License must
appear verbatim on every electronic or printed copy of the RELMA Users' Manual
and the LOINC Users' Guide. The RELMA Users' Manual and the LOINC Users' Guide
may not be modified, nor may derivative works of the RELMA Users' Manual or
LOINC Users' Guide be created, without the prior written permission of the
Regenstrief Institute, Inc. To request written permission, please contact
loinc@loinc.org. The Regenstrief Institute retains the right to approve any
modification to, or derivative work of, the RELMA Users' Manual or the LOINC
Users' Guide.

Notice of Third Party Content and Copyright Terms

A small portion of the content of the LOINC Table, LOINC Table Core, LOINC
Panels and Forms File, LOINC Document Ontology File, LOINC Hierarchies file,
LOINC Linguistic Variants File, LOINC/RSNA Radiology Playbook, LOINC/IEEE
Medical Device Code Mapping Table, RELMA database and associated search index
files consists of content subject to copyright from third parties. This third
party content is either used with permission or under the applicable terms of
use. In all such cases, we have included the copyright notice. The copyright of
the LOINC codes per se remain owned by Regenstrief Institute, Inc. and the LOINC
Committee and subject to the LOINC Copyright Notice and License.

Some included third party content requires attribution specific to a particular
LOINC code or codes. Such third party content is identified in the LOINC Table
and LOINC Table Core by the applicable copyright notice (up to 250 characters)
stored in the EXTERNAL_COPYRIGHT_NOTICE field. In RELMA and our web-based search
application (http://search.loinc.org), the third party content is highlighted as
follows: When such content appears in a search result grid, the programs will
display a field with a link to a page containing the copyright notice and terms
of use for that content. The programs may also visually highlight the rows of
these LOINC codes.

We have included third party content that allows use and distribution at least
for clinical, administrative, and research purposes. The third party copyright
owners generally ask for attribution of the source, allow the free use of the
content for treatment, health care management, and research purposes. They
generally forbid alteration of their content (e.g., survey questions and/or
answers) and use for commercial purpose, which usually means the direct sale of
the survey instruments. They often do allow use of their content in commercial
software, medical record and other clinical database systems, and the messaging
of patient information collected through the use of these instruments.
