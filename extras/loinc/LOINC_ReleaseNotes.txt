9)	Version 1.6 of the Top2000+ Common Lab Results

Overview of edits to existing terms contained in this release:

1)	Updated the nomenclature for Streptococcus pneumoniae from the U.S. serotype numbering system to the widely accepted Danish system. This work included the following:

	- Updated approximately 80 terms in which the number specified in the Component was unambiguous to include "Danish serotype" with the corresponding Danish serotype number
	- Deprecated approximately 200 terms in which the number specified in the Component was ambiguous as to whether it represented the serogroup, U.S. serotype or Danish serotype and mapped to new, unambiguous terms
	- Replaced deprecated terms included in the Top 2000 Common Lab Results US & SI files with the corresponding map to term
	- Added the U.S. serotype numbers as related names to the corresponding Danish serotype Components
	- Added "PCV7", "PCV13" and "PPSV23" as related names to the Components for the serotypes included in the Pneumococcal 7-valent, 13-valent and 23-valent vaccines, respectively.
	- Wrote a new Technical brief about Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype nomenclature in the LOINC Users' Guide

2)	Undeprecated 12 California encephalitis virus terms based on reviewing the latest literature and confirming that California encephalitis virus is a distinct member of the CAL serogroup in addition to LaCrosse virus (LACV), Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), Snowshoe Hare virus, and Trivitattus virus.

3)	Updated approximately 75 cancer pathology terms for one or more reasons, including the following:
	- Removed Method of "CAP cancer protocols" for concepts that are not specific to CAP
	- Changed System from "Cancer.XXX" to "Cancer specimen" for pathology terms to clarify that the observation is specific to a cancer specimen, not the cancer as present in the patient
	- Added answer lists to Ordinal and Nominal terms

4)	Updated the Short Names to say "Plts" (platelets) instead of "Thrb" (thrombocytes) for consistency in terms with "Platelets" as the System.

5)	Updated the Long common Name and Short Name for all radiology terms so that they begin with the modality in order to match the RSNA naming model. This change accounts for nearly 5000 of the 7000 term edits in this release.

6)	Removed the parentheses that were around the gene name in the Component for several terms in the ABXBACT class. This is a work in progress and more terms will be updated for the next release.

7)	In an effort to shorten some of the LOINC Long Common Names, several changes were implemented including:
	- Removed the word "Bacterial" from the Long Common Name for bacterial resistance gene concepts (affected ~20 terms)
	- Changed "Fluorescent in situ Hybridization" to "FISH" (affected ~150 terms)
	- Changed "Dried blood spot" to "DBS" (affected ~380 terms)

Other edits contained in this release:

1)	Thirty-one XR calcaneus terms were deprecated in error when we deprecated CT calcaneus terms during previous the LOINC/RadLex CT unification work. All of the calcaneus XR terms were changed back to active status and further updated to include the Region imaged.

2) 	LOINC 23925-1 Penicillin [Susceptibility] by Gradient strip, is now deprecated and mapped to both 7041-7 Penicillin G [Susceptibility] by Gradient strip, and 7042-5 Penicillin V [Susceptibility] by Gradient strip. LOINC 23925-1 was previously in the Top 2000 file and has been replaced by 7041-7 and 7042-5 in version 1.5. 

3)	About 90 terms in the COAG class with the Method of Imm were updated to have Method of IA to maintain consistency across classes, a change approved by the Laboratory LOINC Committee in December 2016.

4)	The word 'toxin' in the Component for terms that included 'Clostridium tetani toxin Ab' was updated to 'toxoid' to more accurately represent the antibody target.

5)	Components for terms related to Escherichia coli Shiga-like toxin were updated so that they all include the words 'Shiga-like toxin'.
 
6)	Terms that represent antibiotic susceptibilities with different "breakpoints" depending on the type of infection were updated so that the breakpoint information was moved from the Component to the System (see the LOINC Users' Guide for more details).

7)	Ongoing work with RSNA to establish a unified model for naming radiology terms resulted in changes for more than 5000 terms. These changes related to the System across modalities, and to the Component modeling for XR. As part of this work, 31 XR terms with the System Calcaneus that were incorrectly deprecated when the corresponding Calcaneus CT terms were deprecated were undeprecated (CHNG_TYPE 'UND') and returned to 'ACTIVE' Status.

8)	Updated more than 1000 terms that previously had a Method of 'PhenX' to reflect the original source of the content.

9)	The values in the HL7_ATTACHMENT_STRUCTURE changed from STRUCTURED/UNSTRUCTURED to IG exists/No IG exists, respectively, to more accurately convey the concept that "Structured" was meant to represent - that a CDA implementation guide (IG) exists for reporting data in a structured format with the corresponding document code, but not necessarily that such a structure will always be used.

10)	Updated the presentation of the LOINC Users' Guide

11)	Unified the list of fields in the LOINC table whose contents are compared when populating the CHNG_TYPE and VersionLastChanged field. These fields are updated when a change is made in any of the released fields except for: 
	- LOINC_NUM
	- CHNG_TYP
	- VersionLastChanged
	- VersionFirstReleased
	- RelatedNames2
	We exclude the RelatedNames2 field for two reasons: a) it is not one of the primary fields that defines a LOINC concept and b) it changes frequently.


This release contains the following changes to the structure of the LOINC Table:

Field Name: VersionFirstReleased
Formal Definition: The LOINC version number in which the record was first released. For oldest records where the version released number is not known, this field will be null.
Action: Added

Field Name: ValidHL7AttachmentRequest
Formal Definition: A value of 'Y' in this field indicates that this LOINC code can be sent by a payer as part of an HL7 attachment request for additional information.
Action: Added


Notice of changes to the public LOINC data files for the December 2017 Release:

All of the following proposed changes flow from the same rationale: The performance improvements for keeping a smaller field size are minor compared with the hassle of changing field size definitions over time. The Laboratory LOINC Committee recommended a one-time increase in field size to accommodate long term content development and evolution needs.

Field Name: PROPERTY
Formal Definition: Second major axis-property observed (e.g., mass vs. substance)
Action: EXPAND field size from 30 to 255

Field Name: TIME_ASPCT
Formal Definition: Third major axis-timing of the measurement (e.g., point in time vs 24 hours)
Action: EXPAND field size from 15 to 255

Field Name: SYSTEM
Formal Definition: Fourth major axis-type of specimen or system (e.g., serum vs urine)
Action: EXPAND field size from 100 to 255

Field Name: SCALE_TYP
Formal Definition: Fifth major axis-scale of measurement (e.g., qualitative vs. quantitative)
Action: EXPAND field size from 30 to 255

Field Name: METHOD_TYP
Formal Definition: Sixth major axis-method of measurement
Action: EXPAND field size from 50 to 255

Field Name: CLASS
Formal Definition: An arbitrary classification of the terms for grouping related observations together.
Action: EXPAND field size from 20 to 255

Field Name: VersionLastChanged
Formal Definition: The LOINC version number in which the record has last changed. For records that have never been updated after their release, this field will contain the same value as the loinc.VersionFirstReleased field.
Action: EXPAND field size from 10 to 255

Field Name: CHNG_TYPE
Formal Definition: Change Type Code: DEL = delete (deprecate); ADD = add; NAM = change to Analyte/Component (field #2); MAJ = change to name field other than #2 (#3 - #7); MIN = change to field other than name; UND = undelete.
Action: EXPAND field size from 3 to 255

Field Names: STATUS
Formal Definition: ACTIVE = Concept is active. Use at will. TRIAL = Concept is experimental in nature. Use with caution as the concept and associated attributes may change. DISCOURAGED = Concept is not recommended for current use. New mappings to this concept are discouraged; although existing may mappings may continue to be valid in context. Wherever possible, the superseding concept is indicated in the MAP_TO field in the MAP_TO table and should be used instead. DEPRECATED = Concept is deprecated. Concept should not be used, but it is retained in LOINC for historical purposes. Wherever possible, the superseding concept is indicated in the MAP_TO field and should be used both for new mappings and updating existing implementations.
Action: EXPAND field size from 11 to 255

Field Name: SHORTNAME
Formal Definition: Introduced in version 2.07, this field contains the short form of the LOINC name and is created via a table-driven algorithmic process. The short name often includes abbreviations and acronyms.
Action: EXPAND field size from 40 to 255

Field Name: VersionFirstReleased
Formal Definition: The LOINC version number in which the record was first released. For oldest records where the version released number is known, this field will be null.
Action: EXPAND field size from 10 to 255

LOINC version 2.53 was a limited release.


                       +---------------------------+
                       |       Version 2.52        |
                       |    Released June 2015     |
                       +-------------------------- +

Other edits contained in this release:

1)      LOINC 49543-2, Calcidiol+Calciferol [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma, is now deprecated and mapped to 62292-8, 25-Hydroxyvitamin D2+25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma. LOINC 49543-2 was previously in the Top 2000 file and has been replaced by 62292-8 in the current version. 

2)      For CSF specimen collection, changed the Challenge part description of "<number> specimen" to "<number> tube" (e.g. see 46087-3)

3)      For Urine tests with Time XXX, changed the Long Common Name from "...in unspecified time Urine..." to "...in Urine collected for unspecified duration"

4)      Ongoing changes for ACnc/Ord terms to Pr/Ord or Threshold/Ord, including molecular pathology terms for identifying specific variants

5)      Updated the values in the UnitsAndRange field to be consistent with UCUM, and standardized the formatting of the ranges

6)      Updated the ORDER_OBS field from "Observation" to "Both" for several terms based on recommended content changes included in the S&I Framework's aLOINC Order Code Scope Statement (Appendix B, Item 3)

7)      For ultrasound (US) Methods, separated the US imaging modality from the calculation method. For example, US.2D.Teichholz changed to US.2D+Calculated by Teichholz method

8)      Based on Clinical LOINC Committee approval at the February 2015 meeting, terms that specify a look-back period will have timing changed from 'Pt' to the specific time stated by the question. For example, timing changed from 'Pt' to ‘1W’ for terms that specify a look-back period of 7 days. The component did not change and continues to specify the look-back period as well. This work is in progress.

9)      Corrected the Method of several terms that were labeled as "PhenX" but whose provenance was really another source (as stated in the PhenX Toolkit). The Method of these terms was changed to the source name (e.g. NHANES) to clarify the origin of the concept.

10)     Through our ongoing collaboration with RSNA (https://loinc.org/collaboration/rsna), we are establishing a unified model for radiology procedure names. Based on this model, we have implemented several changes to the names of CT terms. A detailed description of the unified naming model will appear in a future version of the LOINC Users' Guide. Over 700 existing radiology terms were edited. Examples of the edits include:

        - Changed route of administration to use abbreviations from the HL7 routes of administration. For example: "inhaled" became "IH", "intrasynovial" became "IS", and "intracervical (uterus)" became "ICV".
        - Revised all uses of "W & WO" to "WO & W" to better reflect the sequence in which they are performed (first without contrast, then with).
        - The specification of anatomic sites in the System now reflects a model that can identify both the body region imaged and the imaging focus. (For example: Abdomen+Pelvis>Urinary bladder)

Action: Deleted

Field Name: CURATED_RANGE_AND_UNITS     
Formal Definition: Units of measure (expressed using UCUM units) and normal ranges for physical quantities and survey scores. Intended as tailorable starter sets for applications that use LOINC forms as a way to capture data. Units are separated from normal ranges by a colon (:) and sets of unit:normal range pairs are separated by a semi-colon (;). Syntax for the normal range includes square brackets, which mean that the number adjacent to the bracket is included, and parentheses, which means that the number itself is not included. For example, [2,4] means "two to four", while [2,4) means "two to less than four" and (2,4) means "between two and four but does not include two and four".
Action: Renamed to UnitsAndRange

Field Name: COMMENTS    
Formal Definition: Narrative text that describes the LOINC term taken as a whole (i.e., taking all of the parts of the term together) or relays information specific to the term, such as the context in which the term was requested or its clinical utility.
Action: Renamed to DefinitionDescription

Field Name: PanelType
Formal Definition: Describes a panel as a "Convenience group", "Organizer", or "Panel".  A "Panel" is an enumerated set of terms that are used together in direct clinical care. The package would typically be thought of as a single orderable item that contains a set of reported observations. A "Convenience group" is an enumerated set of terms used for a common purpose, but not typically orderable as a single unit. An "Organizer" is a subpanel (i.e. a child) within another panel that is only used to group together a set of terms, but is not an independently used entity. They often represent a header in a form, or serve as a navigation concept.
Action: Added

Field Name: AskAtOrderEntry     
Formal Definition: A multivalued field, semicolon delimited list of LOINC codes that represent optional Ask at Order Entry (AOE) observations for a clinical observation or laboratory test. A LOINC term in this field may represent a single AOE observation or a panel containing several AOE observations.
Action: Added

Field Name: AssociatedObservations      
Formal Definition: A multi-valued field, semicolon delimited list of LOINC codes that represent optional associated observation(s) for a clinical observation or laboratory test. A LOINC term in this field may represent a single associated observation or panel containing several associated observations.

                       |  Released December 2014   |
                       +-------------------------- +

9)	New conditionality options, such as "Required with alternative" and "Reflex", for the individual terms in panels that represent complex testing algorithms.

10)	New answer list type of "PREFERRED". Preferred lists contain a set of answers that users are strongly encouraged to use. They represent a recommended set, however alternate result values may be used if necessary.

11)	For terms with an additional third party copyright, we have aligned the content in the EXTERNAL_COPYRIGHT_NOTICE field of the LOINC table with the COPYRIGHT and TERMS_OF_USE fields in the Source Organization table.

12)	As part of internal database improvements, we cleaned up some content in the RELATEDNAMES2 field of the LOINC table and reordered the related names into alphabetical order. As a result, nearly every record in the LOINC table was updated. Since the content is essentially the same, we did not flag these edits with a change type of 'MIN'.


This release includes one change to the structure of the LOINC Table:

Field Name: LOINC.EXTERNAL_COPYRIGHT_LINK
Formal Definition: For terms with an additional third party copyright, this field is populated with the COPYRIGHT_ID from the Source Organization table (see Table 28c in the LOINC Manual).
Action: Add


This release includes several changes to the structure of the LOINC panels and forms file. We have added the following fields for more complete representation of survey instruments and forms:

Field Name: FORMS.QuestionCardinality
Formal Definition: Controls the cardinality of a question on a form. The lower range will be 0 for optional questions or 1 for mandatory questions. The upper range is a number > 0. This value indicates number of times that this question can be asked. "*" is used as a special flag to indicate that there is no upper bound.
Action: Add

Field Name: FORMS.AnswerCardinality
Formal Definition: Controls the cardinality of the answers on a form. The lower range will be 0, indicating that the user is not required to answer the question, or 1, indicating that the user is required to answer the question. The upper range is a number > 0. This value indicates number of answers is allowed. "*" is used as a special flag to indicate that there is no upper bound.
Action: Add

Field Name: LOINCS.EXTERNAL_COPYRIGHT_LINK
Formal Definition: For terms with an additional third party copyright, this field is populated with the COPYRIGHT_ID from the Source Organization table (see Table 28c in the LOINC Manual).
Action: Add

Field Name: ANSWERS.Description
Formal Definition: Detailed description for an answer
Action: Add

Field Name: ANSWERS.Score
Formal Definition: Score value for the answer. Used in instruments where response values are used to calculate one or more scores.
Action: Add

Field Name: ANSWERS.SubsequentTextPrompt
Formal Definition: Text that should be displayed when a user chooses this answer. A value in this field indicates that choosing this answer should result in the user being prompted to provide an additional free text input, e.g. "Other, please specify".
Action: Add

Field Name: ANSWERS.AnswerListId
Formal Definition: The LOINC answer list ID. Answer list IDs begin with ‘LL’ followed by a numeric identifier, e.g. LL512-5.
Action: Add

Field Name: ANSWERS.AnswerListName
Formal Definition: The descriptive name for an answer list. (As mentioned above, we are in the process of updating answer list names to better reflect their content).
Action: Add


Notice of changes to the public LOINC data files for the December 2015 Release:

Field Name: ANSWERS.CODE_SYSTEM_OID
Formal Definition: The Object Identifier (OID) for the answer list. This OID may be assigned by Regenstrief or another Registration Authority.
Action:	Rename to ANSWER_LIST.OID
Discussion: The current name implies that the OID for the value set is tied to a specific code system. In fact, the OID identifies the value set (answer list), not the code system from which individual answer codes in the list is drawn. An answer list can be comprised of codes from a single code system or, in some cases, it can include codes from multiple code systems. (This structure of codes from multiple code systems in a single list is supported by FHIR.) Changing the name will help to disambiguate the purpose of the field. This field is contained in the LOINC panels and forms file.

Field Name: LOINC.FORMULA
Formal Definition: Contains the formula in human readable form, for calculating the value of any measure that is based on an algebraic or other formula except those for which the component expresses the formula. So Sodium/creatinine does not need a formula, but Free T3 index does.
Action: EXPAND from text (255) to memo
Discussion: The LOINC content developers have been jumping through hoops to make some formulas fit the field limit (255 characters). Truncating or unnecessarily fiddling with formulas to fit the field limit makes things harder than it needs to be for both LOINC staff and LOINC users. Expanding the size of this field will give us the space needed to properly document the formula.
As an example, here is a formula that currently is 472 characters long:

"GT = BetaT * (DT + [TSH]) * (1 + K41 [TBG] + K42 [TBPA]) * [FT4] / (AlphaT * [TSH]) or GT = BetaT * (DT + [TSH]) * [TT4] / (AlphaT * [TSH]) from serum or plasma concentrations of thyrotropin (TSH) and free (FT4) or total (TT4) thyroxine and some constants (AlphaT = Dilution factor for T4: 0.1 l 1; BetaT = Clearance exponent for T4: 1.1e-6 sec-1; K41 = Dissociation constant T4-TBG: 2e10 l/mol; K42 = Dissociation constant T4-TBPA: 2e8 l/mol, DT = EC50 for TSH: 2.75 mU/l)"

Field Name: LOINC.DATE_LAST_CHANGED
Formal Definition: Date last changed.
Action: DELETE and add a "VersionLastChanged" field.
Discussion: The exact date a LOINC term was edited by Regenstrief staff is unnecessary for LOINC users and actually difficult for us to maintain accurately. We know that the dates there now are not 100% accurate. We believe the most helpful thing for users would be a "LOINC Version Number When Last Changed" field. We plan remove the DATE_LAST_CHANGED field and insert a "VersionLastChanged" field.

                       |  Released December 2013   |
                       +-------------------------- +

LOINC version 2.46 contains 73,115 terms, an increase of 490 since the June 2013 version. Approximately 300 terms have been edited. A total of 2191 terms have been deprecated. 

This release includes over 300 laboratory, 110 clinical or attachment, and 47 survey-related terms.  Some highlights of the new content in this version include: 

1)	Approximately 75 drug/toxicology tests, including confirmation tests for specific Polychlorobiphenyl (PCB) congeners and the NBOMe series of hallucinogenic chemicals as well as analysis on unknown substances (e.g. unknown powders, liquids, capsules, tablets, syringe contents, etc.).  

2)	Over sixty hematology/blood count related tests on various specimens, including cord blood (post-delivery), fetal blood (in utero), and bone marrow.  

3)	Over 40 chemistry tests, including observation for newborn screening.

4)	Approximately 80 new codes in microbiology and serology, including codes for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and Major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related antigen A (MICA) antigens.  A few codes are veterinary-specific, including tests for Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and prion protein analysis.

5)	New laboratory panels, including the new 2014 HEDIS Value Sets, CBC with Differential panel for Cord blood , MICA (Major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related antigen A ) IgG antibodies, MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) coronavirus RNA panel, and a Mycobacterium tuberculosis stimulated gamma interferon & spot count panel.

6)	Several new terms for action plans (submitted by SE Minnesota Beacon program), including anaphylaxis, autism, ADHD, cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, muscular dystrophy, and diabetes type I and II action plans.

7)	Codes representing interRAI© clinical assessments for home health care, palliative care, acute care, long term care facility, emergency screener for psychiatry, contact and  community health assessments.

8)	Codes for several forms or survey instruments, including:
	- Nursing Management Minimum Data Set (NMMDS), questions on nurse job satisfaction: LOINC 74182-7, NMMDS job satisfaction panel
	- AHRQ Patient safety event report - hospital: medication or other substance - version 1.2: LOINC 74080-3

9)	Codes created for (but not limited in use to) several HL7 Implementation Guides and registry reports, including:
	- HL7 IG for CDAR2: Clinical Oncology Patient Transfer Summary, Release 1: see LOINC 74156-1, Oncology treatment plan and summary Document
	- HL7 Implementation Guide for CDA® Release 2.0: Form Definition and Questionnaire response documents, Release 1: see LOINCs 74468-0, 74465-6, 74467-2 and 74466-4.
	- HL7 Version 3 Implementation Guide: Virtual Medical Record for Clinical Decision Support (vMR-CDS), Release 1: see LOINC 74028-2, Virtual Medical Record for Clinical Decision Support panel HL7-VMR-CDS
	- HL7 CDA HIV/AIDS Services Report Implementation Guide: see LOINC 74264-3, HIV summary registry report
	- American College of Surgeons, National Trauma Databank (NTDB): see LOINC 74198-3, Trauma summary registry report

This release also includes significant updates to LOINC Document Ontology: 

1) 	With the guidance of the Clinical LOINC Committee, we extensively reviewed existing clinical document type codes and compared them to the set of Document Ontology axis values that the Committee had approved for new terms. This review has been in process for several years, but we have now completed it for all terms in the DOC.CLINRPT class. As a result of this review, several clinical document terms were either revised or deprecated.

2)	Based on decisions from this review, we have updated the LOINC Document Ontology hierarchies and axis values in the LOINC database, on the LOINC website (http://loinc.org/discussion-documents/document-ontology), and in the Users Guide. The LOINC Users Guide serves as the official version of the LOINC Document Ontology (see Section 7).

3) 	Beginning with this release (v2.46), we provide the part numbers for clinical document axis values in the LOINC Users Guide. In addition, the Clinical document parts, part number, and part type (e.g. Subject matter domain, Type of service, etc.) can be viewed in RELMA under the parts search tab (see page 53 of the RELMA manual). The linkage between LOINC codes in the DOC.CLINRPT class and the set of document ontology axis values they contain are provided in the LOINC Document Ontology File that is a separate download in the LOINC distribution. 

4) 	New terms are available to report a LOINC Document Ontology axis value (Kind of document, Type of service, Setting, Subject matter domain, and Role). See LOINCs 74477-1, 74478-9, 74476-3, 74480-5, and 74479-7 or search on "LOINC Document Ontology". For example, you could send 11506-3 'Provider-unspecified Progress note', and then report the Role as a separate accompanying segment using 74479-7 'Clinical document Role from LOINC Document Ontology'.

5) 	This work was performed in synchrony with work in HL7 to develop the "HL7 Implementation Guide: LOINC Clinical Document Ontology", which can serve as a helpful resource for LOINC Document Ontology Users.

Other edits contained in this release:
Where present, we removed tab and line feed characters within the Long Common Name field (primarily PhenX terms). We also continue the clean-up effort started in version 2.44  for replacing extended ASCII and UNICODE characters above code point 127 with more common ASCII characters, where appropriate. We expect this effort to take several more cycles to complete.  

Notice of upcoming file name changes:
In our ongoing effort to provide consistency and uniformity in the LOINC release artifacts, we are updating our file naming conventions. Beginning with the June 2014 release most, if not all, not all file names will use the following naming convention: LOINC_<version#>_<ArtifactLabel>.<Extension>. 
For example, we expect to rename the file LOINC_242_NEWBORN_SCREENING_PANELS.zip that was included in the 2.42 release to LOINC_246_NewbornScreeningPanels.zip in the June 2014 release.

Notice of discontinuation of tab-delimited file format:
As we announced previously, this release discontinues publication of the tab-delimited format of the LOINC Table (may it rest in peace). The CSV format is now the sole text format distribution.

                       |   Version 2.44            |
                       |  Released June 2013       |
                       +-------------------------- +

LOINC version 2.44 contains 72,625 terms, an increase of 1,161 since the December 2012 version. Approximately 2,408 terms have been edited. A total of 2,168 terms have been deprecated.Some highlights of the new content in this version include:1)	Over 600 drug induced platelet and neutrophil antibody terms.  2)	More than 100 terms for antibiotic susceptibility testing.3)	Over 80 terms in toxicology, primarily related to synthetic cannabinoid testing.4)	New codes for the 2003 version of US Standard Birth Certificate and Fetal Death Report panels, LOINCs 68988-4 and 69045-3.   5)	New codes for newborn hearing and critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) screening, added to the American Health Information Community (AHIC) newborn screening panel, LOINC 54089-8.  6)	Terms for the Neonatal Skin Risk Assessment Scale (NSRAS), LOINC 73790-8.This release also two major types of edits to LOINC content:
1)	We have made many edits as part of our ongoing effort to replace our temporary, "placeholder" use of ACnc for ordinal terms with more appropriate properties of Pr or Threshold (as described in the LOINC Users' Guide). Approximately 560 blood bank terms were changed from ACnc to Pr to reflect the new model for ordinal terms where results are reported as present or absent. Over 965 Drug/Tox terms were changed from ACnc to Threshold since the reported results are based on an internal cutoff or threshold value. 
2)	For consistency and uniformity, we are replacing some extended ASCII and UNICODE characters above code point 127 with more common ASCII characters, where appropriate. Many edits are simple substitutions, such as replacing left and right specific quotation marks with the equivalent ASCII quotation mark. Others involve a multi-character string replacement, like changing the ellipsis character to the "..." string or replacing the trademark symbol with "(tm)". Our new delimited text format of the LOINC table is UTF-8 CSV, and there are fields where we will specifically allow Unicode characters. For example, in the FORMULA field we us Greek alpha and beta characters to accurately represent the mathematical formula. Likewise, the EXTERNAL_COPYRIGHT_NOTICE field will contain copyright symbols (naturally). We expect to make the replacements in several iterations.

NOTICE OF UPCOMING FILE NAME CHANGES
In our ongoing effort to provide consistency and uniformity in the LOINC release artifacts, we are updating our file naming conventions. Beginning with the June 2014 release most, if not all, not all file names will use the following naming convention: LOINC_<version#>_<ArtifactLabel>.<Extension>. 

For example, we expect to rename the file LOINC_242_NEWBORN_SCREENING_PANELS.zip that was included in the 2.42 release to LOINC_246_NewbornScreeningPanels.zip in the June 2014 release.

                       +---------------------------+
                       |   Version 2.42            |
                       |  Released December 2012   |
                       +-------------------------- +

LOINC version 2.42 is the 50th release of the LOINC database. This version contains 71,464 terms, an increase of 775 since the June 2012 version. Approximately 7,563 terms have been edited. A total of 1,844 terms have been deprecated.The majority of edits for this release are in Radiology where terms with a scale of "Nar" are changed to "Doc" to fit with the Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) model. This release also includes edits made to several concentration ratio properties. CCrto, MCrto, and SCrto are changed to CRto, MRto, and SRto, respectively, since the volume cancels out when the ratio of measurements is calculated. Additionally, the property for ordinal terms with a method of screen or confirm in the Drug/Tox Class are changed from "ACnc" to "Threshold" since the results (e.g. present/absent) are based on a cutoff or threshold value. This release includes terms requested by several organizations and instrument vendors across many classes. We added more than 100 terms in the toxicology, chemistry, and hematology classes and more than 40 molecular pathology terms. We've also added more than 50 new radiology terms and several new survey instruments. This release also includes two changes to the fields in the LOINC Table:1)	The MAP_TO field is no longer be distributed with the LOINC Table. It was originally created to store a single replacement LOINC term number for when a LOINC was deprecated. We later learned that there were times when there was more than one possible replacement term, depending on certain conditions. To address this problem we created a new MAP_TO table (initially released with version 2.34) obviated the need for this field. 2)	We have added the HL7_ATTACHMENT_STRUCTURE field to the LONIC Table. We've continued to work closely with the HL7 Attachments Work Group to support their mission of developing electronic healthcare claims standards. In the context of attachments covered under HIPAA, the current proposals use LOINC codes in a couple of ways. One way is to identify the attachment type (e.g. a Discharge Summary or Radiology Report) when creating and sending attachments. This new field will help identify which LOINC codes that are approved by the HL7 AWG to be used in this manner and what format they should be sent in: whether as Structured content using the C-CDA or with the Unstructured template of C-CDA. More detail about how this field will be used will be published in an upcoming HL7 supplement document.

Use at will.	TRIAL: Concept is experimental in nature. Use with caution as it may change.	DISCOURAGED: Concept is not recommended for current use. New mappings to this concept are discouraged, but existing mappings may still remain valid.	DEPRECATED: Concept is deprecated. Concept should not be used, but is retained in LOINC for historical purposes. The superseding concept is indicated wherever possible in the MAP_TO field.Included in this release is a large number of DRUG/TOX terms requested by a toxicology and forensic testing laboratory and a number of new CARD.US terms for pediatic ultrasound.

Microsoft ended most support for Access97 on August 31, 2001 and is dropping all remaining support on January 16, 2004. Therefore, we are beginning the process of converting from Access97 to Access2002. Within the next year or two LOINC and RELMA will be distributed in the new format. If you just use the RELMA program, this change should be completely transparent. However, if you access the database directly or through some other program, this change may cause incompatibilities. We are hoping that by giving this advance notice, you will be able to avoid any problems. If you would like to discuss this issue with LOINC/RELMA developers, please e-mail LOINC@regenstrief.orgFor more information on Microsoft life cycle support, go to:http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;[ln];lifeOffice*********************** IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT ***********************

LOINC version 2.07 contains 32,046 records, an increase of 1457 terms since the release of version 2.04. Of these, 921 have been deprecated (STATUS = DEL). A new field called Shortname has been added. The fully specified LOINC name is long and sometimes awkward, so we don't envision it being used as the label for standard clinical reports and have rules for naming orderable results. Over the last 7 years we have had many requests for a universal "short name" that could be used in HL7 messages and, perhaps on delivered reports. In this release we include our first attempt at the developing of such short names. At this stage we have limited the scope of this effort to laboratory tests excluding challenge tests, which have particularly long names that can be difficult to squeeze into a specified limit. The LOINC committee recommended that the short name be no more than 30 characters in length. We have not quite made the limit in all cases and or still working to improve the meaningfulness and the fit of these LOINC short names. We recommend these names be sent along with the LOINC code and as the 2nd part of the HL7 CE data type in HL7 messages. These short names are unique, but they are subject to change as we develop better algorithms for generating short names. The terms in the classes of DRUG and TOX have been moved to a new class DRUG/TOX. Terms in the classes of BC and HEM have been moved to a new class HEM/BC.Approximately 6000 term have been edited since the release of version 2.04. This includes the terms that were moved to the new classes.

LOINC version 2.04 contains 30,589 records, an increase of 1267 terms. Of these 854 have been deprecated (STATUS = DEL). A new field, RelatedNames2 has been added to the database. It contains synonyms for all parts of the fully specified LOINC name (component, property, time, system, scale, method). It may eventually replace #8, Relat_NMS. This is the field that is being used by RELMA 3.5.A major revision of Allergy terms has been undertaken. In the past (prior to LOINC vs 2.04), we used the common name, rather than the scientific name to identify the allergen. However, this approach led to some duplicate term definitions, because two different companies would name the same allergen differently. It also led to ambiguity because two different species of animal or plant would some times have the same common name. This year we corrected these problems.One new class, VACCIN, has been added to the database.In addition to the creation of the RelatedNames2 field creation, more then 2800 records were edited since the release of version 2.03.

The fist click will sort the data in ascendingorder, subsequent clicks will toggle the sorting between ascending anddescending order.5. The tab order of the fields on the MAP screen has been corrected tothe more standard left-to-right top-to-bottom order.6. The new "Size Grd" button on the mapping screen will automaticallysize the results grid so that all text will be displayed. Note - thisprocess can be time consuming if there are more than several hundredrows to size.7. The mapping function now has the optional capability of limitingsearch results to LOINC codes that are compatible with the units fieldof the LMOF. To utilize this function you must include UNITS whenimporting your local code set into the LMOF table. See the RELMA usermanual for addition details.

Chlamydia was added to the related names field.Retired terms:Twenty-three (23) duplicate terms have been marked "DEL" in the STATUS field. DOCUMENTATION:This release has documentation only in Microsoft Word and Adobe PDF formats. No significant changes have been made to either the LOINC User's Guide or the RELMA Manual. Updated documentation will be available in the next release.RELMA:	Version 2.0	Release date:  February 4, 20001. Problems corrected from version 1.211.1 Corrected a problem where certain combinations of CLASS and SUBCLASS restrictions erroneously returned "No Match" when there did exist records that met the search criteria.1.2 Corrected a problem that caused error messages when printing under certain conditions.2. Significant changes to program:2.1. The program was ported from 16-bit Visual Basic version 4 to 32 bit Visual basic 6.0. As a result RELMA will no longer install or run under Windows 3.1.2.2. The underlying MS Access databases used by RELMA have been converted from MS Access 2.0 to MSAccess97. You can no longer use Access 2.0 to view or modify the RELMA databases.2.3. The setup program now uses the Microsoft CAB style setup files. Additionally, the LOINC database, LOINCACS.MDB is no longer stored as a separate ZIP file within the setup files. Instead, it is compressed as part of the CAB file. Therefore, the PKUNZIP utility is no longer supplied with the distribution. As part of the installation process one or more VB 6 specific Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) may need to be installed on your machine. Installing these DLLs will require a reboot of the machine and should be considered a normal part of the installation process.3. New features in the 32-bit version:3.1 The program has a new icon.3.2. The mapping screen is now scalable. 3.3. The "/" forward slash character is now treated a special delimiter and is replaced by a SPACE for indexing and keyword search operations. This corrects a problem in version 1.21 where the keyword SER would not return records with a system of SER/PLAS.3.4. After clicking the Clear All button the cursor is now automatically placed in the 1st keyword text box.3.5. The access key for the "Clear All" button on the "LOINC Input Form" form has been changed from ALT+C to ALT+A to remove the conflict with the access key for the "Find Local Code" button.4. Instructions to run on 16 bit version using database in Access 2.0:4.1. Find Database folder on CD and select the file LOINCV2 and copy.4.2. Locate directory where RELMA is installed and paste LOINCV2 into this folder.4.3. Rename LOINCV2 to LOINCACS.4.4. Run RELMA by double clicking on RELMA.EXE  Program will run, but warn user that "latest database version is not found."  Click "OK" on the dialog box and program should proceed to main menu form. The number of LOINC codes should appear at the top of the form in parenthesis.4.5. WARNING:  Do not use the 32-bit version of database with RELMA version 1.21 or less. The 16-bit version of Access is supplied as a bridge for Microsoft Windows 3.1 users. We advise loading the 32-bit version of RELMA.ADOBE ACROBAT:This CD contains the Adobe Acrobat4.0 reader. To install the reader, simply run the program ACRD4ENU.EXE (located in the Acrobat directory) and follow the instruction that appear on your screen. The reader is also available, free of charge, at www.adobe.com.

LOINC:LOINC Version 1.0Ma contains 21,741 records. Of these, 452 are "retired" (STATUS=DEL) and 21,290 are active. This is an increase of 1,890 total terms and 1,866 active terms from LOINC 1.0L. As usual we have added new terms across a wide range of laboratory classes. This release includes our first batch of molecular genetic terms (more than 200), LOINC variables developed in collaboration with NAACCR for tumor registry, and terms developed in collaboration with HL7 Attachment SIG for electronic claims attachments.We apologize for a number of errors in the release of version M we sent you early in July and to anyone who received copies of this data. The Word version of the user's guide had formatting errors due to a last minute (and un-noticed) conversion from one version of Word to another. We have corrected this error. More than 20 records contained fields with embedded CR/LF characters. These would not be a problem to users of the ACCESS database, but would cause problems to most applications that import the ASCII tab delimited file into anotherdata base. We have removed the offending CR/LFs. A few records did not have the right class designators and a number of Attachment records did not get the new LOINC class type designator of 3 so you would not find them if you restricted your search to the Attachment class type. Finally, the word index for the release of RELMA was not sorted properly before it was installed. Hence the list of matching options would not appear in alpha order by component, property, timing, system, etc, as it had in the past. These are all corrected in this"re-release" which we are calling Version 1.0Ma. This version includes the first release of any terms dedicated solely to Claims attachments. There are a few known minor imperfections in the naming of some of these Attachment terms. Because documents containing these minor problems are already working their way through a release of proposed federal regulations, we thought it better to deal with these when we receive comments about the proposed regulations to avoid differences the LOINC data base and the documents that are undergoing review. DOCUMENTATION:This is the last release that will include documentation in Wordperfect format. In the future, documentation will be provided in Microsoft Word and Adobe PDF formats.RELMA:Some users complained that the local description text box did not enable to view a complete description when it was longer than would fit in the text box. The user can now move the cursor to this field, double-click it, and a popup window shows the full local code description.Known problems with RELMA1. Applying a  "Class Restriction" with no "Sub Restriction" will cause an erroneous "no Match" error. To avoid this behavior, always specify a "Sub Restriction" when using the "Class Restriction."   This problem will be corrected in the next release.2. In some situations, using a "Sub Restriction"  will not properly limit the search results to the specified class. This problem will be corrected in the next release.

This includes a systematically generated group of 340 new terms to flesh out drug-of-abuse screen and confirm reporting, including information on variable cutoff thresholds. This system is explained more completely in the LOINC Users' Guide. The other additions include new specimens (FLU, TISS, VITF, AMN, FOOD, MILK) and timed urine specimens for various occupational and environmental toxins such as acetone, mercury, manganese, etc.US.ECHONew class, containing 410 terms, for recording cardiac echo measurements.Four new fields have been added to the LOINC database, and some previously included fields have been removed or altered. A full list is provided below; those fields which have been changed are marked with an asterisk.

This is due in part to more specificity in the inclusion of index words in the word index file. We take pains to enter a word only once in the word index for a given record, no matter how many times it might be repeated in the indexable records. We have also used a special mechanism for indexing words found in the ACM synonym list, which is very extensive and includes a host of brand names, even for non-drug products that contain substances that are included in LOINC test names. For example, Warfarin is a component of a variety of rodent poisons, and brandnames for those poisons are included in the ACS synonym list. We have always translated special characters such as "^", "/" and "." that may be found in the LOINC names into blanks for the purpose of the indexing and searching within RELMA. The only exception is that we keep decimal points that are parts of a decimal number. E.g., we do not convert "5.6" into "5 6". We may have had an error in this process in past releases, such that some slashes were retained, with the effect that a few phrases may not have been separated into single words for indexing purposes. The downside of our removing these special characters is that they do not appear in the list of matched LOINC records. (They will appear when you do a look up on the specific terms because that goes directly to the original LOINC field.)Though we believe we do not now include the same word more than once in the index for a given LOINC record, you can do a search and find the same LOINC record represented more than once in the list of LOINC record matches. This should only occur with some wild card searches. For example, a searched for "AB*" would find a match with "Abalone" and "AB". So you may have duplicate records in the table of matches. You can eliminate such duplicates by pressing the dup button on the RELMA mapping screen.The items in the list of potential matches will now be sorted alphabetically by LOINC name, this will make it easier to visually find a particular term when the list of matches is long.LOINC User's GuideWe have made a number of changes to the LOINC manual explaining our approach to some naming more fully (especially to toxicology naming), adding terms to tables and correcting small errors. Katherine Mercer from Laboratory Services, Ontario Ministry of Health, has been especially helpful with her careful reading andsuggestions for edits. Also, she noted a number of examples that are not now reflective of real terms in the database.We appreciate everyone's patience on the slow gestation of this version. In the next release we hope to have a good starting set of terms for molecular pathology testing, a beginning on test order sets, terminology needed for tumor registry reporting, and an expanded set of terms required for testing in veterinary medicine.

These first terms represent microbiology results for antibodies and antigens to bacteria and viruses which are important infectious agents in commercial livestock. In future releases, we will also include chemistry tests for non-human species. To accommodate this expansion of the database, we have also added a new field (SPECIES) which contains codes reporting which animal species the term relates to. If the field is blank, "human" is to be assumed the relevant species.Three new fields have been added to the LOINC database, as described below42 CSCQ_FRNCH_NM  Char  255  French name for LOINC term.

Also, ACUTE and CONVALESCENT changed to 1st SPECIMEN and 2nd SPECIMEN, Acute and Convalescent added to RELAT_NMSCorrected delimiters (some terms had .SUPINE rather than ^SUPINE, etc.)The formal names of Vitamin D varieties were corrected to correspond to the more familiar numbered name which appeared in the related names field: Cholecalciferol instead of calciferol; calciferol instead ofergocalciferol, and a term was added for ergosterol, which was missing from the database.Changed "COCAINE" to "BENZOYLCOGONINE" and "CANNABINOIDS" to "TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL" for all specimens otherthan BLD, SER/PLAS, and USUB, since cocaine/cannabinoids are detectable only in those specimens.Added denominators of xFRs where previously omitted, especially electrophoresis fractions and METHMOGLOBIN."SPERM" changed to "SPERMATOZOA"; SPERM added to RELAT_NMSAdded "SP" to micro tests that detect genera, not individual species.Changed storage mite ab terms so that Latin name is component and storage mite is in related names. Also corrected spelling of Tyrophagus putrescentiae."Q WAVE" replaces "Q-WAVE"A,B AB and AG Previously, blood bank tests for antibodies/antigens to both A and B were named AB AB and AB AG, which was ambiguous and confusing).

In this release of LOINC, QL is replaced by NOM (for nominal), SQ is replaced by ORD (for ordinal) and SQN is replaced by ORDQN. There is also an expanded discussion of the SCALE field, including examples, in the revised version of the Users' Guide, dated April 1998.Terms retired:107 terms have been marked "DEL" in the STATUS field, meaning they should no longer be used. Three were incorrect or nonexistent blood bank tests for which no corresponding correct term or concept could be identified; the remaining 104 were either duplicates of existing terms or erroneous terms for which new correct terms were constructed; these terms are mapped to the correct replacement terms in the MAP_TO field.

Version 1.0J-a is a slight modification of 1.0J, which corrects a few errors in the database.)Release 1.0J-a of the LOINC database contains 13,465 terms, including 2,613 terms new in this release.Class      Changes/Additions-----      -----------------ABXBACT    Precision of agar diffusion and MIC changed to SQN to            accommodate both semiquantitative and quantitative            reporting.ALLERGY    Added 110 new IgE antibody terms for allergens.BC         Added 80 terms, including many terms for cells found in            bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid, and other non-blood            specimens, and terms for cell morphology.CELLMARK   Added: 19 new termsCHAL       Added 279 new terms, including many new terms for recording            unspecified challenges.CHEM       Added 433 new terms, including terms for many analytes in            amniotic fluid, peritoneal dialysis fluid, and unspecified            body fluid.DRUG       Added 219 new terms.ED         Added: 190 new terms adopted from CDC DEEDS (Data Elements FUNCTION   for Emergency Department Systems) data dictionary for H&P.HX     recording emergency department variables.HEM        Added: 18 new termsHLA        Added: 15 new termsMICRO      Added: 318 new terms, including non-method specific terms            for many antibody tests.OB.US      Added: Completely new class containing 558 terms to            describe measurements and observations taken during            obstetric ultrasound examination.SERO       Added: 102 new terms, including non-method specific terms            for many antibody tests.TOX        Added: 123 new terms, including both new analytes in serum            and/or urine, and specimens such as hair, nails, meconium,            and vitreous fluid.Changes in the database structureFour new fields have been added to the database:CLASSTYPEWith the merging of the laboratory and clinical databases in the last release, we perceived a need to easily separate the database into these two groups. Thus we assigned a new variable, CLASSTYPE, which equals "1" if the terms is in a LAB class and "2" if it is in a CLINIC class.FORMULAMany of the OB.US (obstetric ultrasound) terms are calculations based on regression formulae published in the clinical literature. We added the FORMULA field to store the details of these regression equations. MULTUM_CDMultum Inc. produces a database of codes for drugs, similar to the Medispan codes which are already included in the LOINC database. Multum has graciously provided us with a map between their drug code values and the drug terms included in the LOINC database. We added this field to store those values.DEEDS_CDThe CDC has developed a data dictionary listing terms relevant to emergency department care and has assigned code values to those terms. This field contains the DEEDS code value which maps to the LOINC code in question.A complete listing of the field locations, sizes, and types follows.Position   Name          Type   Size1          LOINC_NUM     Text     72          COMPONENT     Text   1503          PROPERTY      Text    104          TIME_ASPCT    Text    105          SYSTEM        Text    506          SCALE_TYP     Text    307          METHOD_TYP    Text    508          RELAT_NMS     Text   2549          CLASS         Text    2010         SOURCE        Text     811         EUCLIDE_CD    Text    1012         ASTM_CD       Text     913         IUPAC_CD      Text     814         DT_LAST_CH    Text     815         CHNG_REAS     Text   25416         CHNG_TYPE     Text     317         COMMENTS      Text   25418         ANSWERLIST    Text   25419         STATUS        Text     320         MAP_TO        Text     721         SCOPE         Text   25422         SNOWMED_CD    Text    1023         VA_CD         Text     824         METPATH_CD    Text    1025         HCFA_CD       Text    1226         CDC_CD        Text     627         NORM_RANGE    Text    3028         EX_US_UNIT    Text    3029         IPCC_UNITS    Text    3030         GPI_CD        Text    1131         GPI_CD_TOT    Text   25432         REFERENCE     Text   25433         EXACT_CMP_SY  Text   25434         MOLAR_MASS    Text    1335         IUPC_ANLT_CD  Text    1336         ANSWERLIST2   Text   25437         ANSWERLIST3   Text   25438         CLASSTYPE     Integer  239         FORMULA       Text   25540         MULTUM_CD    Text      641         DEEDS_CD     Text      7Changes to RELMAThere have been numerous changes to the RELMA program since the last documented version (0.96 Beta). Some of the changes are "visible" to the user (e.g., new program options) while others are not (e.g., changes in data organization, speed improvements, etc.). The most obvious change is in the size of the database itself. There are now over 13,400 LOINC terms in the database with more than 7,600 keywords and 170,000 searchable components. Despite the increased database size, most searches are completed in less than a second on a Pentium machine. These improvements come at a cost, however. The disk space required by RELMA has increased to almost 70M, of which over 65M is just for the database. Some of the major highlights in this release include the following.The LMOF (Local Master Observation File) table has been split out from the LOINCACS.MDB database into its own database file (LMOF.MDB). This was done to make updating the LOINC database safer and easier for the user.The routine for importing local numbers and descriptions is more flexible.Searches can be restricted by class (e.g., Lab or Clinic) and subclasses (e.g., CHEM, CHAL, etc.).Keywords for searching the database can be automatically toggled.Persistent keywords: If the user types in a keyword in any of the last three keyword boxes (keyword boxes 8, 9, and 10), these keywords do not disappear as the user moves from one local code to the next.Easier access to LOINC details: A left-mouse click now highlights a row in the grid box and a right-mouse click then causes details for the highlighted LOINC number to be presented.Duplicate removal: When wildcard searches are done, it is possible for duplicate LOINC numbers to be presented. A new button removes these duplicates and sorts the output by description. Clicking on the "No Dups" button when there are no duplicates still sorts the grid box output by description, which may be usefulto the user.Double-click mapping: Once a LOINC a term is highlighted in the grid box, double-clicking immediately maps the highlighted LOINC term to the local code. This speeds up the mapping process considerably compared to earlier versions of RELMA.New program options: One option permits the user to output the content of the LMOF table to an ASCII file. A second option allows the user to read the ASCII file back into the LMOF table. New report options: You can sort the output of various reports. In most cases, you can elect to have the output ordered by: 1) physical file order, 2) LOINC number, 3) LOINC description, 4) local code number, or 5) local description.Speed improvements: The data structures have been changed to reduce database search times.

In release 1.0i, we have added 1,040 records in the areas ofsurgical pathology, immune stains, microbiology, blood banking,fertility, and others. A new class, SURGPATH, has been created torepresent surgical pathology terms. The Users' Guide has beenupdated to reflect the many changes that have taken place sinceApril 1996, including the recent release of the Clinical LOINC database.Important: The syntax representing observations made on an entity other than the patient has been changed. The SYSTEM_TYP field may now contain a modifier delimited with the "^" character. This change may require some users to modify the procedures they have developed to import or parse LOINC terms into their data applications. Please consult Section 2.5.1 of the new Users' Guide for more information on this change.

LOINC News: In July 1996, the American Clinical Laboratory Association (ACLA) endorsed LOINC and is now recommending that all of its member report laboratory results using LOINC codes. The 40+ members of the ACLA account for approximately 70% of the volume of tests performed in the United States. Also, ICD10 PCS codes for HCFA are being now constructed based on LOINC terms. Finally, Ontario, Canada is very interested in the use of LOINC codes for province-wide laboratory result reporting.Corrections to existing terms     SUPER Convention: Previously we used "LITTLE" in the      component/analyte name to indicate that the following     alphabetic character is lower case in the official name. In     this release we similarly employ the word "SUPER" to     indicate that the following character is a superscript     according to official nomenclature.      Blood bank: The parentheses included in the names of blood      bank antigens were mostly unnecessary. They should not have     been included according to our naming rules for specifying     lower case alphabetic terms (LITTLE) unless, as in a few     cases, the lowercase letter is enclosed by parentheses in     the formal name. These have been corrected in this release.Changes to standard report format: We have changed the content of the printable (WordPerfect and Word) LOINC reports in the following ways:  The ASTM Code, IUPAC Code, MetPath Code, and Comments columns are no longer displayed. They are still maintained in the database, they are just not printed on the word processing reports. Columns representing the Exact Core Component Synonym, Change Reason, IUPAC Analyte Code, and Molar Mass have been added to the report. (The Exact Core Component Synonym, IUPAC Analyte Code, and Molar Mass fields are new to LOINC with Release 1.0h -- see Section 4 for a description.) We stress that this is a change to the printed reports only; we have not and never will change the order of the fields in the database itself (in either the tab-delimited ASCII "LOINDBT1.TXT" or the dBase "LOINC.DBF" formats). The order of the columns on the reports is now:StatusClassLoinc NumberMap ToAnalyte/Component NameType of PropertyTime AspectSystem/SpecimenType of ScaleMethodRelated NamesExact Core Component SynonymDate Last ChangedReason for ChangeAnswer ListEUCLIDES CodeIUPAC Analyte CodeMolar Mass     New data fields: 3 new fields have been added and populated withdata for many observations:Field #   Field Name               Type      Width33        XCT_CMP_SY          C         25434        MOLAR_MASS          C         1335        IUP_ANL_CD          C         13     Field 33: Exact core component synonym: This field contains     an exact synonym for the "core component" of the LOINC     component name. We have included the mixed case and     "superscript" form of blood bank and HLA antigens (e.g.,     Lua) here to make it easier for automatic matching programs.     As there is no ASCII character for superscript letters, we     use the hat (^) to signify that the next character is a     superscript in these exact synonyms. (E.g., if the core     component is represented as L LITTLE U LITTLE SUPER A in the     LOINC component/analyte name field, it is represented in the     Exact Core Synonym field as Lu^a.) In a future release we     will add more exact synonyms for the core components.     Field 34: Molecular weights: This field contains the     molecular weights of many chemical moieties when they are     provided to us. Those added in this release were kindly     contributed by IUPAC.     Field 35: IUPAC analyte code: This field contains the     Chemical Abstract service number or the Enzyme Nomenclature     number for the chemical components for chemicals and/or     enzymes. These were also contributed by IUPAC.New observations: We have added 1,559 terms in the following areas:     Susceptibilities based on antibiotic gradient strips     (E-tests):We have added observations to represent each of     the antibiotics for which susceptibilities can be performed     via antibiotic gradient strips.     Allergen testing: serum IGE and basophil bound antibodies:     We have significantly enlarged the set of serum IGE allergen     tests, and have added a large number of tests for basophil     bound antibodies to specific allergens using the leukocyte     histamine release method. This test may be more clinically     predictive than the serum based IGE allergen tests. Most of     these allergen test terms were contributed by Lab Corp and     Corning MetPath.      We edited the allergen names so that the part of the name     that corresponds most closely to the genus comes first, the     species comes next, and finer specification comes last. So     an IGE AB against Live Oak would be listed as OAK LIVE     AB.IGE. The IGE AB against Interior Live Oak would be listed     OAK LIVE INTERIOR AB.IGE. If the allergen came from a     particular part of the tree (e.g., bark) it would be OAK     LIVE INTERIOR BARK AB.IGE. (Of course, common names do not     always align well with the corresponding scientific name.)     In the future, we will work toward including the Latin     scientific name for each of the species represented in these     allergen tests in the exact component synonym field.      Microbiology expansion: We have added many terms to the     microbiology section to deal with exotic infections,     antigens and antibodies against more specific subspecies     (especially for viruses), and scattered IGM and IGG     measures. Some of these additions were made in response to     the CDCs communicable disease electronic reporting project,     with which we are cooperating.     Lymphocyte bound CD antigens: Corning MetPath contributed     approximately 40 new terms for reporting levels and ratios     of lymphocyte bound CD antigens.New "Type of Scale" Level: We have introduced a new category for Type of Scale. The new category, "SQN,"applies to results that can be reported as either QN or SQ scales.

Approximately 350 terms added: allergen IGE tests (these are often called RAST tests, after the commonly used method, but more than one method is used) and coagulation tests - mostly beginning with the letters P through Z -- which were inadvertently omitted from Release 1.0a. We have established links between LOINC codes and approximately 1500 MetPath codes. These are mapped in METPATH_CODE.In most instances, we have supplied properties for the records whose property fields were blank. Most of these terms are in the hematology class.We identified a number of duplicate entries. Usually these had quite different names but the names were synonyms. In these cases, one of the duplicates was marked "DEL" in the STATUS field, and the MAP_TO field of that record contains a pointer to the correct record. In every case the LOINC record with the smaller LOINCnumber was identified as the preferred LOINC record and the other one was marked as a "deleted term." (Records are never actually deleted from the LOINC database, but if a term should no longer be used, the value of STATUS will be set to DEL.)

"MAP_TO" field added to provide mapping to new terms when old terms are marked for logical deletion (we put a "DEL" in the STATUS field to indicate this.)  We added 16 coagulation terms to the WP version; these terms were in the 1.0 release of the ASCII database but were mistakenly omitted from the WordPerfect 1.0 release. We marked term 3173-2 (Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time) as STATUS="DEL" because it was a duplicate of term 5898-2 (Coagulation Surface Induced, which carries APTT and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time assynonyms). In BC (blood count) terms, METHOD=FLOW CYTOMETER changed to METHOD = AUTOMATED COUNT to more accurately reflect lab terminology.                         +-------------------+                       |   Version 1.0     |                       | Released 04/24/95 |                       +-------------------+
